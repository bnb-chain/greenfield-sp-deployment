# Create a SP cluster

Pre-requisite is that AWS resources must first be created. Please see aws section for details.

Then, using `kustomize`, you can create the app in K8S (EKS) very quickly.


## Cluster Size Selection
We currently support a number of cluster modes, depending on the requirements of performance.
1. all-in-one: All services of SP are deployed in a single pod.
2. regular: An arrangement where some services will be combined as a pod.
3. large: Each service is a pod by itself.

## Setting up K8S via kustomize

To set up a primary SP cluster, using `kustomize` we can deploy it with the following YAML. You can
replace the `value`s with yours in the YAML file. 

```

### Config file

Here is the config file used in the above `configMapGenerator`. You will need to obtain and 
replace `SpOperatorAddress`, `ChainID`, `GreenfieldAddresses` and `TendermintAddresses` from your env.

```

## Setting up secret

The SP app also will fetch secret from AWS (used as external secret in K8S). Please see AWS
doc for creating the secret. The secret JSON content will be like the followings:

```json
{
    "SP_DB_USER":"xxx",
    "SP_DB_PASSWORD":"xxx",
    "SP_DB_ADDRESS":"xxx.rds.amazonaws.com:3306",
    "SP_DB_DATABASE":"storage_provider_db",
    "BLOCK_SYNCER_DSN":"user:pw@tcp(xxx.rds.amazonaws.com:3306)/block_syncer?parseTime=true&multiStatements=true&loc=Local",
    "BS_DB_USER":"xxx",
    "BS_DB_PASSWORD":"xxx",
    "BS_DB_ADDRESS":"xxx.rds.amazonaws.com:3306",
    "BS_DB_DATABASE":"block_syncer",
    "SIGNER_OPERATOR_PRIV_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "SIGNER_FUNDING_PRIV_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "SIGNER_APPROVAL_PRIV_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "SIGNER_SEAL_PRIV_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "BUCKET_URL":"xxx",
    "P2P_PRIVATE_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "SIGNER_GC_PRIV_KEY":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "BS_DB_SWITCHED_USER":"xxx",
    "BS_DB_SWITCHED_PASSWORD":"xxx",
    "BS_DB_SWITCHED_ADDRESS":"xxx.rds.amazonaws.com:3306",
    "BS_DB_SWITCHED_DATABASE":"block_syncer_backup",
    "BLOCK_SYNCER_DSN_SWITCHED":"user:pw@tcp(xxx.rds.amazonaws.com:3306)/block_syncer_backup?parseTime=true&multiStatements=true&loc=Local"
}
```
